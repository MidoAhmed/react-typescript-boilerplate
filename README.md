# react typescript boilerplate üöÄüöÄüöÄ

Is an opinionated web app boilerplate including web development tools and workflow of react ecosystem, industry-standard tools, best practices and a scalable base template.
A solid starting point for enterprise-grade projects

> This work made with love to setup this architecture and dev environment for new react.js projects.

## Benefits

- Quickstart a project in seconds and focus on features, not on frameworks or tools

- Industrial-grade tools, ready for usage in a continuous integration environment and DevOps

- Scalable architecture with base app template including example components, services and tests

## Features

- <b>Typescript</b>

  - Typescript is the key to scalability, easy-to-debug code and create maintainable large applications and codebases with a highly productive development experience.

- <b>Predictable state management (Flux)</b>

  - Unidirectional data flow allows for change logging and time travel debugging.

- <b>Mock API</b>

  - Start development immediatly even if the real APIs haven't been created yet (Independence, backup-plan, Ultra-fast, Test slowness, Aids testing).

- <b>Next generation CSS/SASS</b>

  - SASS Stylesheets using The 7-1 architecture pattern from Sass Guidelines
  - Inline Styling

- <b>Best Practices </b>

  - Solid workflow to make your code healthy

- <b>Test setup (Jest Testing framework for React applications)</b>

  - Automatically guarantee code quality and non-breaking changes.

- <b>Code quality (linting) for Typescript.</b>

  - Tslint + Eslint + prettier = ‚ù§Ô∏è

- <b>Commit conventions : validate commit conventions automatically (commitlint + husky + commitizen)</b>
  - Automatically check and enforce your commit conventions
  - Commitlint integration with Travis CI (Continous Integration)
  - Commit message wizard (tools available that help (new joiners or external contributors) with crafting compliant commit messages.) : commitizen + git-cz

## In progress Features

- <b>i18n internationalization</b>

  - Easily add and support multiple languages.

- <b>Quick scaffolding</b>

  - Create components, containers, routes...

- <b>TypeScript source code Documentation</b>

  - Use a documentation generator for TypeScript projects such as or other alternative - https://typedoc.org/

- <b>Environment Configuration</b>
  - development, staging and production environment configurations

## Getting Started

- `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

- `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

- `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

- NB: This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
